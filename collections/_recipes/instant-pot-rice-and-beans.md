Instant Pot Rice and Beans
Makes a stupidly large amount, can freeze for later.


1 ¼ cups black beans (soaked overnight)
1 ½ cups brown rice
1 cup salsa
½ bunch of cilantro, divide stems and leaves
3 cups broth (I use water)
2 cups water
(so.. 5 cups water total when I make it)


1. Separate cilantro leaves and stems, keep both
2. Add rice and beans to instant pot
3. Gently pour water and broth over beans and rice, stir
4. Next add salsa and cilantro stems to pot, do NOT stir
5. Manual high 25 minutes, 10 minutes keep warm natural release
6. When serving add cilantro leaves


I eat these in tortillas. The cilantro stems add the majority of the flavor which was really surprising. Very tasty for few ingredients.Original Recipe: https://frommybowl.com/instant-pot-rice-beans/
