<h2>Directions</h2>

This goes a little by feel. With the half a recipe above:
<li>Put the black beans through a food processor until they are almost a paste.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, beat an egg.</li>
<li>Add the black bean paste to the bowl with the egg and and spices (cumin, garlic, etc.).</li>
<li>Add cracker or bread crumbs (I put crackers through my food processor to do this) until not leaving goopy gunk on your hands but not crumbling apart</li>
<li>Press into hamburger shape.</li>
<li>Can fry in pan, or cook in oven 350F for 5 mins a side. Since there is egg I usually make sure they’re done by checking the internal temp at like 160F. Doesn’t take much, if overcooked they’ll be a little dry.</li>

You can create cracker crumbs by throwing some crackers in the food processor.
