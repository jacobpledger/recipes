# Food Processor Pizza Dough

[ ] 1.5 tsp yeast
[ ] 1 tsp sugar
[ ] 3/4 cup warm water
[ ] 2 cups flour
[ ] 3/4 tsp salt
[ ] 2 tsp olive oil

I usually make this in a processor but I think you could do it by hand.
Combine water and sugar in bowl. Add yeast and let sit for about 10 minutes until proofed.
In large bowl/processor, combine flour and salt. Add oil then gradually add yeast, mix and knead until smooth and not really sticky. Lightly oil dough and put it in a new bowl and cover it with a towel dampened with warm water. Place in warm location (like _barely_ warmed oven). Let rise 10 minutes.
Flour counter, top of dough, rolling pin from centre. Once as large as stone you can curl up sides and pinch to make crust.

Make sure bottom of dough is floured enough to prevent sticking to stone.
Poke all dough all over with fork to prevent bubbles. Cook at 425F for 10 minutes. Check dough at around 5 minutes to poke/flatten bubbles with spatula if they occur.

Remove from oven, add ingredients, then cook for another ~10 minutes.
Note: this recipe also works with instant rise yeast. Use directions on package on how to knead + rise. I prefer non-instant for thicker crust.
