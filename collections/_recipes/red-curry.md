Red Curry (Not instant pot but easy)


1 chicken breast or 1 to 1 1/2 cups Cooked desi or kabuli (normal) chickpeas


1 chopped onion
14 oz (half a big 28oz can) diced tomatoes


1 Tbsp minced garlic
1 1/2 tsp ginger
1 Tbsp curry powder ( I ignore this and double the other spices.. because mustard and I like the taste better..)
1 tsp cumin
1 tsp turmeric
1 tsp coriander


1 cup plain yogurt OR
1/2 cup plain yogurt and 1/2 cup coconut milk OR
1/2 to 1 full can coconut milk
(I do w/e based on what I have, can mix yogurt with a little less than 1:1 flour in bowl before hand to make it thicken curry better)


1) Chop chicken, fry, and put aside OR cook chick peas (instant pot probably)
2) Fry onions, garlic and ginger until soft/transluscent (I blend these into paste in the food processor then cook)
3) Add spices and a little water to make pasty mix, cook for a little
4) Turn down to low, add tomatoes, yogurt/coconut milk, need to do quick after adding tomatoes or it will curdle. Slowly heat back up to medium
5) Add chicken or chickpeas
