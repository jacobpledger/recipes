## Notes

* You really just throw everything in the instant pot and let it cook.
* Good with tortilla chips
* WITH FROZEN CHICKEN: Just keep the cook time the same. The long cook time is to ensure the rice cooks through so frozen or fresh chicken will work. It may take a few extra minutes for the pressure to come up, but the recipe will turn out great.




Instant Pot Salsa Chicken 
1 1/2 cups brown rice
3/4 cup salsa
1 15 oz can pinto beans
1 1/2 cups frozen corn
1 1/2 cups chicken broth (I use water)
1-2 whole chicken breast (can be frozen but not stuck together)


1 tsp chili powder
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp cumin
1/2 tsp salt


Cheddar cheese to put on top of servings after cooked


1) Combine all in instant pot (not cheese), nestle chicken breasts down into mixture in middle not touching, liquid doesn’t have to completely cover
2) Set Manual (high pressure) 24 mins
3) 10 mins keep warm natural release
4) Remove chicken and shred, mix back in


Add cheese, you can eat these plain in a bowl or with nacho chips, I sometimes put them in wraps with lettuce and chili sauce.
